# Receipt to Money-Manager

Only support to parse Willys and Lidl receipt (both in Swedish lang) at the moment as I mostly shop there. Contribution are welcome

- Import your Willys receipt (pdf) or Lidl (image - make sure to import in highest quality)
- Output in `xls` format and you can import it to money manager via backup feature
- Support multiple receipt at once, so it only generate single xls
